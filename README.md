## Description
This is a simple form-based React application that demonstrates form validation with a set of predefined input fields. The form contains First Name, Last Name, Password, and Confirm Password fields, along with a validation mechanism that checks for specific conditions when the user submits the form.

## Features
- Responsive UI that works seamlessly across devices.
- A validation (Sign In) button that checks for errors in the form.
- Placeholder values for every input field.
- Validation checks to ensure:
  - None of the form fields are left empty.
  - The First Name is at least 5 characters long.
  - The Last Name is at least 5 characters long.
  - The Password and Confirm Password fields match exactly.
  
If the validation passes with no errors, the user is shown a "Logged-In" page.

## Validation Logic
1. **Empty Fields**: Ensures all fields are filled in before proceeding.
2. **First Name Length**: Checks if the First Name is at least 5 characters long.
3. **Last Name Length**: Ensures the Last Name is at least 5 characters long.
4. **Password Match**: Verifies that the Password and Confirm Password fields match.
